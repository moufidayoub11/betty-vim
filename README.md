### Technical Details for Better Understanding

#### Vimscript Functions

- `BettyToggle()`: Toggles the extension on and off. It uses the global variable `g:betty_isActive` to keep track of the state.
  
- `DisplayCurrentLineMessage()`: Displays the message for the current line if it exists. It uses the `g:betty_messages` dictionary to look up messages.

- `BettyCheckAndHighlight()`: Checks and highlights issues in the code. It writes the file and then runs the Betty Style Checker on it.

- `HandleBettyNotFound()`: Handles the case where the Betty Style Checker is not found on the system.

- `ClearOldHighlights()`: Clears old highlights and messages. It uses `g:betty_match_ids` to keep track of the highlights.

- `ParseBettyOutput()`: Parses the output from the Betty Style Checker and populates `g:betty_messages`.

- `ApplyNewHighlights()`: Applies new highlights based on `g:betty_messages`.

#### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Dictionary**: `g:betty_messages` is a dictionary that maps line numbers to messages and their types. It is used for quick look-up.

- **Array**: `g:betty_match_ids` is an array that stores the match IDs for highlights. It is used for efficient deletion of old highlights.

#### Practical Applications

- **Real-time Feedback**: This extension provides real-time feedback, which is crucial for identifying and fixing errors quickly.
  
- **Code Quality**: By adhering to Betty coding standards, the quality of the code is improved, making it more readable and maintainable.
